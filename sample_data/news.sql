The global offshore wind market is set to significantly grow over the next two decades, increasing by 13 percent every year until 2040, the IEA estimates in its

Offshore wind capacity around the world is set to jump 15-fold by 2040, becoming a US$1-trillion industry. This would match the capital expenditures on natural gas and coal-fired power capacity over the next two decades, the Paris-based agency says.
Currently, offshore wind accounts for just 0.3 percent of global power generation, but the potential for the industry is huge, according to the IEA’s Executive Director Fatih Birol.
“In the past decade, two major areas of technological innovation have been game-changers in the energy system by substantially driving down costs: the shale revolution and the rise of solar PV,” Birol said in a statement.
“And offshore wind has the potential to join their ranks in terms of steep cost reduction,” the IEA’s executive director noted.
Between 2010 and 2018, the global offshore wind market grew by almost 30 percent, thanks to rapid technology improvements. Europe, especially countries on the North Sea such as 
, Denmark, and 
, has been leading offshore wind capacity development and fostered technological advances. Yet, last year, it was China that added the most offshore wind capacity than any other country—1.6 gigawatts (GW), the IEA said.
Europe will continue to be the technology leader through 2040, but China will close the gap. In the United States, state-level targets set the course for rapid growth over the next decade, the IEA said.

While the transition may prove overwhelming for smaller producers, larger companies are playing a long game, casting ahead to a period where greener technology helps slash their costs.
Sustainability has been a long-standing issue in metals, covering a wide range of issues including corruption, board structure, jobs, communities around mines and mine waste.
But environmental concerns have moved to the top of the agenda in recent years with heightened awareness of climate change amid public protests.
Metals and mining are responsible for 10% of the total impact on climate change, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.
“We’re turning down lots of stuff. Being green is a precondition for lending,” said Laurent Charbonnier, global head of metals and mining at HSBC, speaking ahead of LME Week when the world’s metal industry gathers in London.
Mine operators now face extensive checklists from lenders before they release funds and listed companies are being screened by fund managers before they buy their shares.
Assets in global “sustainable” funds have doubled over the past five years to $844 billion by end June, according to research firm Morningstar.
“For us, the scrutiny is all around us,” said Shishir Poddar, executive chairman of Tirupati Graphite plc, which plans to list in London.
The metals and mining industry will need around $240 billion of investment over the next decade to produce key base metals and gold, according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
More funding, however, is conditional on meeting environmental, social and governance (ESG) guidelines, burdening operators with extra investment.
“You may have to take another 25% to create the right societal engagements and environmental designs,” said Simon Morris, global head of metals at Wood Mackenzie.
“So will investors accept lower returns? I think it’s probably causing a bit of head scratching around the industry in this tug-of-war of priorities,” added Morris, who formerly worked for global miner Rio Tinto plc.
Bigger metals groups have the financial bulk to absorb the higher investment.
BHP Group, the world’s biggest miner, signed four renewable energy contracts earlier this month to supply all its Chilean copper operations from 2021.
But the new contracts came at a price – BHP took a provision of about $780 million related to the cancellation of existing coal contracts.
Such costs are more challenging for smaller companies.
“The problem for these companies is raising sufficient funds to build the mine,” said analyst John Meyer at boutique investment bank SP Angel. “To add another $50 to $100 million to put in a solar power plant is quite difficult.”
In many cases, bringing mines in line with environmental standards is moving hand-in-hand with new technologies that will boost efficiency and cut operating costs in the long term.
Large mining groups like BHP and Anglo American are investing in solar power, automation and water-saving technologies, betting that substantial up-front investment will both burnish their green credentials and raise efficiency.
“Following sustainability goals doesn’t necessarily equate to an increase in costs,” said Rachael Bartels, senior managing director at consultancy Accenture.
Although BHP had to take a big hit to cancel its coal contracts in Chile, the group says the new renewable power contracts, beginning in 2021, will cut energy costs by 20%.
Replacing diesel generators with electric motors in new underground mines could cut upfront costs by about a third because it cuts out ventilators that extract the diesel fumes, a study by EY found.
Anglo American has been testing new mining processing technology in Chile that is expected to lift productivity by as much as a third and could also slash capital costs for new mines.
Capital intensity, ratio of initial capital expenditure to annual production capacity, for new copper mines has tripled over the past 36 years to about $18,000 per tonne, according to Morgan Stanley.
But Anglo’s new technology has the potential to almost slice capital intensity in half below $10,000 a tonne, the bank said in a note.
Anglo declined to release capital intensity figures but said in an email the new technologies were “game-changers” in terms of both the environmental footprint and costs.

Venezuela’s state oil firm PDVSA must make a payment of US$913 million on a 2020 bond on Monday, October 28, but the bond is widely expected to go into default because the Venezuelan oil firm doesn’t have the money to make the payment.

Equinor had initially expected to start production from 
—the North Sea giant as it calls it—in November. The Johan Sverdrup field was put in production earlier than that, on October 5, while five wells are currently producing oil, Equinor said in its Q3 results release today.
With expected resources of 2.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent, Johan Sverdrup is 
 on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) ever made and one of the largest industrial projects in Norway in the next fifty years, according to Equinor.
All eight pre-drilled wells at Johan Sverdrup are expected to be put in production by the end of next month, Equinor said today, noting that this would give the field a production capacity well above 300,000 bpd. Johan Sverdrup is expected to reach plateau production in the summer of 2020.
Daily production during the first phase of the Johan Sverdrup development is estimated at 440,000 bpd, while peak production is expected to reach 660,000 bpd. At peak production, Johan Sverdrup will account for 25 percent of Norway’s total petroleum production.

The Sverdrup crude is already a hit among Asian customers even before the first shipment. Chinese Unipec, an independent refiner in China, and South Korean Hyundai Oilbank have purchased cargoes of Johan Sverdrup for delivery in December, refinery officials and traders told 
 this week. Sverdrup’s low sulfur content and medium-density perfectly fit the in-demand crude specifics in Asia right now, according to traders. The new grade is also cheaper than its immediate competitors with which it has been compared, Brazil’s Lula and Angola’s Saturno. If Asian refiners continue to like Sverdrup, Norway could take some market share from Brazil and Angola on the Asian market, according to Bloomberg.

On Friday, a congressionally mandated 
 said that climate change will cost the U.S. economy hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century, ranging across numerous sectors including health care and infrastructure.
The 1,656-page assessment was written with the help of more than a dozen U.S. government agencies and departments and outlines the projected impact of global warming on every corner of American society in what some have called a dire warning. “With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century - more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many U.S. states,” the report, 
 said.
The report added that global warming would disproportionately hurt the poor, broadly undermine human health, damage infrastructure, limit the availability of water, alter coastlines, and boost costs in industries from farming, to fisheries and energy production. However, it offered hope if changes could be made. It said that projections of further damage could change if greenhouse gas emissions are sharply curbed, even though many of the impacts of climate change (including more frequent and more powerful storms, droughts and flooding) are already under way. “Future risks from climate change depend primarily on decisions made today,” it added.
However, the White House has countered the report, calling it inaccurate. White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the new report was “largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends by assuming that...there would be limited technology and innovation, and a rapidly expanding population.” She added that the government’s next update of the National Climate Assessment “gives us the opportunity to provide for a more transparent and data-driven process that includes fuller information on the range of potential scenarios and outcomes.”
The report also comes amid a presidential administration that has been the most pro oil and gas industry on record and one whose policies, particularly rolling back Obama-era environmental policies, have set environmentalists on edge. In mid-2017, the U.S. withdrew from the Paris climate change accord, the only country to have approved the historic accord then withdraw from it. 
Scientists who worked on the report said it did not appear that administration officials had tried to alter or suppress its findings. However, several said the timing of its release, at 2 p.m. the day after Thanksgiving, appeared designed to minimize its public impact. 
The report, which was written before California''s recent deadly fires, also says the last few years have smashed records for damaging weather in the U.S., costing nearly $400 billion since 2015. "Warmer and drier conditions have contributed to an increase in large forest fires in the western United States and interior Alaska. "We are seeing the things we said would be happening, happen now in real life," said report co-author Katharine Hayhoe of Texas Tech University. "As a climate scientist it is almost surreal." Donald Wuebbles, a co-author of the report, and a University of Illinois climate scientist, said, "We''re going to continue to see severe weather events get stronger and more intense."
The report is mandated by law every few years and is based on hundreds of previously research studies. It details how global warming from the burning of coal, oil and gas is hurting each region of the U.S. and how it impacts different sectors of the economy, including energy and agriculture.
Despite the report, there is no indication that the Trump administration will alter its policies. In fact, Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign pledge of reviving the country’s coal industry is gaining momentum. In August, the Trump Administration released details of a new energy policy that would disregard regulations on coal-fired power plants. The Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule would take power plant emissions standards out of federal hands and put it in the hands of individual states to develop their own plans to cut pollution.
Some fear that the ACE Rule will replace the Obama era Clean Power Plan (CPP) which was supposed to address the problems related to climate change. However, ACE has largely been attacked by coastal states as a weaker plan since it allows individual state the latitude to write their own rules on emissions from coal- fired plants. According to a Reuters report in October, the heads of environmental and energy agencies from 14 mostly coastal states, including California, New York and North Carolina, told the EPA in joint comments that the proposed plan would result in minimal reductions of greenhouse gases, and possibly result in increased emissions, relative to having no federal program on the pollution.

EPA’s move comes as the world gathers in Poland for what is being dubbed the most important meeting on climate change since the 2015 Paris Agreement, which President Donald Trump has criticized repeatedly.
It also follows the US push to edit a G20 communique by adding a paragraph emphasizing that the US "reiterates its decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and affirms its strong commitment to economic growth and energy access and security, utilizing all energy sources and technologies, while protecting the environment." 
Janet McCabe, who served as the EPA’s acting assistant administrator for Office of Air and Radiation during the Obama administration and helped shape the existing rule told

McCabe called the emissions standards set during her watch “appropriate” and said the current administration will likely have to defend in court its reasons for easing them.
"Today''s proposal is nothing more than another thoughtless attempt by the Trump Administration to prop up their backwards and false narrative about reviving coal at the expense of science, public safety, and reality," Mary Anne Hitt, senior director of Sierra Club''s Beyond Coal campaign, said in a statement.

Despite a U.S, delegation declaring its intention to burn more fossil fuels at an environmental conference in Poland, sounding like the energized, fossil fuel advocate and former Alaska governor Sara Palin saying, “Carbon? You betcha!”, on December 20 a group of 93 institutional investors with $11.5 trillion under management published a letter in the 
The letter stated strongly that “we require power companies… to plan their future in a net zero carbon economy…. We expect specific timelines and commitments…”
These institutional investors, typically a fairly conservative group, stated more or less accurately that the electric power generating sector accounts for one-quarter of global carbon emissions. And that sector had better clean up its act, so to speak, and do it with relative haste. For example, the investors want all coal-fired power generation owned by portfolio companies shuttered by 2030, that is, within the next decade.
Furthermore, these enviro-investors assert that action on climate change remediation delivers offsetting economic benefits. To them, carbon reduction should not be seen at all as an economic negative. This, however, is not the first demand for carbon reduction by investors, and probably will not be the last.
Although $11.5 trillion of investments sounds like a large number, it pales in comparison with the total world market for stock and bonds, which totals about $160 trillion, more or less. The anti-carbon investment movement does not, at least at this point, speak for all investors. (The market value of all US electric utility company stocks and bonds totals about $1.2 trillion, incidentally.) 
But also consider the dynamics of investment management. Managers do not like to take public positions that annoy important clients. It’s kind of a basic rule. Large oil companies, for example, might not retain pension fund managers who speak out aggressively about global warming. But above all else, investment management resembles a sport. It is all about the team’s performance on game day. No one wants or can long afford to underperform their competitors, occurs by retaining positions in companies which, so to speak, never saw it coming. And managers charged with acting in a fiduciary capacity seldom relish explaining why they failed to anticipate elevated risk and declining return prospects in a significant portion of the stocks comprising their portfolios.
There is an enormous amount of money currently dedicated to passive investing with portfolios that essentially mirror the existing market or relevant subset thereof. In the US, the electric utility industry despite its importance for the economy and overall welfare of the population, comprises a rather small portion of the equity market, only 2-3%.
In other words, it is possible for institutional investors to build robust portfolios that approximate the market’s composition without owning any electric utility stocks. The electric utility industry is barely a factor with respect to broad market indices like the S&P 500. Investment managers wishing to avoid controversy and investors expressing environmental preferences can now both jettison fossil-fueled electricity generators and suppliers from their portfolios without affecting performance. 
As an aside we should point out that this new attitude toward carbon emissions could soon put electric companies in the so-called “sin bin” along with liquor distillers, cigarette manufacturers and casino operators — stocks that cause offense to one group or another. Future investors will have to account for not only the usual panoply of business and operating risks. But now there is the additional stigma. And electric company executives may also begin to see diminishing prospects to both their careers and their finances.
Electric utility companies in the US and Europe are already moving away from coal and other fossil fuels. As a boiler fuel coal is rapidly losing market share to natural gas. This switch alone reduces CO2 emissions by roughly one half. However, the future of electric power generation over the next decades may turn out to be a rather unpleasant competition between natural gas and the declining cost curves of renewables. These dynamics spring from engineering progress and changing economics rather than investor activism alone. In short, pressure from investors may accelerate a trend already underway.

It is exacerbated by the country’s predilection for subsidies and set against the backdrop of a chronic power generation landscape.
As any regular traveler to India will know, while power outages are not as common as they once were, they remain an almost daily occurrence in many areas. According to the 
, quoting figures from the New Delhi-based Energy and Resources Institute, per-capita electricity consumption by the country’s 1.3 billion people is just 38 percent of the global average, while tens of millions of households still lack grid connections — so demand growth is high and set to continue for decades to come.
Not surprisingly, the government has made the push for reliable, universally available electricity a long-running key policy priority; a policy based largely on coal-fired coal plants that was roundly condemned by both environmental organizations and many Western governments.
Coal is the only fossil fuel India has in abundance, with extensive deposits situated in the northeast of the country, although power plants in the west and south often import coal from Indonesia rather than haul product across the country on a rickety rail network. Oil and gas have never been favored because they are largely imported. 
As for those subsidies mentioned earlier, the Gujarat state government has just awarded two major coal plants run by Adani — 
 and 
 — increased power rates to help stem heavy losses the plants are incurring due to uneconomic imported coal supply costs.
Part of the problem for coal-fired plants has always been competitively priced coal supplies; even though the country has abundant supplies, it suffers from an appalling logistics infrastructure. Today, only plants sited very near to the deposits in northeastern India remain viable. Most of the rest are in trouble, with Credit Suisse estimating half of them as being ‘stressed’ – i.e. interest payment exceeding profits – putting some $35 billion of investments at risk, the FT reports.
The second — and, in many ways, more profound — dynamic at work is the collapse of renewable energy power prices.
According to the FT, Japan’s SoftBank, as part of a consortium in 2017 agreed to sell power from a northern Indian solar park for Rs2.44 per unit, well below the cost of coal power, which typically costs well over Rs3. Last year, state-run NTPC — by far the biggest thermal power producer in India — has canceled several plans for large coal projects, including one for a giant 4GW plant in southern Andhra Pradesh state, while 
 invested more than $600 million in a solar plant in sunny southern Tamil Nadu. Coal is no longer seen as economically viable in India — not from an environmental point of view, but purely based on the cost of production. 
Not surprisingly, in recent meetings, state thermal power station equipment manufacturers were bemoaning (off the record) the dire state of the market, with little on offer except repair and maintenance.
After he was elected in 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government set an ambitious target of increasing India’s renewable energy capacity by 2022 to 175GW, equivalent to 40 percent of the country’s total power capacity. This was a target seen as more for external consumption than a genuine strategy; but last year, despite the backlog of coal-fired plants still in the works, more solar power capacity was brought on stream than coal, suggesting the 40 percent target may yet be achieved, particularly if better storage solutions can be achieved to smooth out the variability of renewable power supply.
Until then, coal plants are still needed to provide base-load and increasingly intermittent power, a role they are not as well suited to as gas, but in the absence of anything else may be of such need that those subsidies keep rolling in.

. 
Betting everything on Wyoming and Montana strip mines, the company gambled that easy-to-access coal for electricity plants would secure its future for years to come. At first, the bet panned out - the company grew into the third largest U.S. miner at one point, while its competitors went bankrupt due to overleveraging themselves. But now, as coal power plants continue to fade away, Cloud Peak is doing the same.
On Friday the company warned that it may be filing for Chapter 11 in weeks - becoming an unfortunate example of an industry that has declined precipitously. Coal has been displaced by natural gas and renewable energy in recent years, despite the Trump administration rolling back environmental regulations to try and help the industry. 
Jeremy Sussman, an analyst with Clarksons Platou Securities, said of Cloud Peak: "This is not a problem with a fix." 
Cloud Peak was formerly a spinoff of Rio Tinto Group more than a decade ago. The industry today is extremely different. Production and consumption in the coal industry are both down more than a third since then and the "fuel that made up almost half of the U.S. power mix at the time is expected to supply less than 25 percent this year", according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Cloud Peak stayed focused on thermal coal for power plants while rivals took on debt to try and expand production of metallurgical coal, which is used in steelmaking - a niche of the industry Cloud Peak never took hold of. Despite competitors Peabody and Arch filing for bankruptcy in 2016 while Cloud Peak reported a $21.8 million profit, the tables have now turned. 
Since Chapter 11, both Peabody and Arch have kept their balance sheets clean and are posting good results. The demand for metallurgical coal has caused its price to double since 2016. It remains a great source of revenue for miners - except Cloud Peak.
Cloud Peak has also missed out on exports, which were up 91% last year from 2016. Exports have helped miners in the Appalachians and the Illinois Basin, but with Cloud Peak located in the plains of Wyoming and Montana, it''s hardly a help for them. The company does ship some coal from Vancouver, however, and exported about 11% of its third quarter output.
However, states like Washington and Oregon have blocked efforts to ship coal from the U.S. west coast, which has limited the company''s options. The company posted a $718 million loss for 2018 on Friday, compared to just a $6.6 million loss in 2017. Tons sold was down by 14%. 
Lucas Pipes, an analyst with B. Riley FBR Inc. said that the company could have broadened its strategy by expanding into met coal, but that window, now, has obviously closed.

, the International Energy Agency said energy companies continued investing in coal as demand for electricity continued growing fast and renewable and nuclear capacity additions couldn’t keep up. But, the agency said, “decisions to invest in coal-fired power plants declined to their lowest level this century and retirements rose.”
When something happens for the first time in a century, it’s definitely worth mentioning, especially if it marks the change in a persistent trend. This is not to say that coal power will be eliminated from the world’s energy mix within the lifetime of those who are now in their thirties and forties. Yet the fact that last year retirements of coal plants exceeded the number of final investment decisions on new ones suggests we may be witnessing peak coal.
Bloomberg’s David Fickling 
 in a commentary piece on IEA’s report that coal capacity retirement has been already going strong for several years in Europe and North America: in Europe, coal’s down by 25 percent since 2009 and in North America its part in total generation capacity has fallen by as much as 40 percent. Yet Asian demand for power has spurred a 63-percent jump in coal capacity in that powerhouse of the world.
Add to this the other 236 GW of coal capacity under construction around the world and the good news of coal plant retirements versus final investment decisions begins to seem insignificant. It is, however, anything but. First steps are usually the hardest and this is no exception. The world will continue needing coal for quite some time as global population growth leads to a substantial increase in energy demand. However, if more of an effort is made to make renewables cost-competitive with coal in the places where there is the greatest need for more energy, the demise of the dirtiest of fossil fuels might accelerate.
It is a big if, that’s for sure. Last year, new renewable energy capacity additions globally remained 
 on 2017, disappointing everyone who expects a renewable revolution that will change the face of energy.
Among the different types of renewable energy, solar was by far 
, with total additions at 97 GW last year, unchanged on 2017. Wind power capacity additions, however, inched up to 50 GW last year, from 48 GW in 2017. New hydropower capacity additions, however, declined to 20 GW in 2018, from 25 GW in 2017. The total stood at 180 GW, which is a bit more than half of the 300 GW in renewable power that the world needs to add annually until 2030 if we are to meet the 2050 goals of the Paris Agreement. 
These figures from an earlier IEA report did not go into detail about the reasons behind this slowdown in renewable additions but it is becoming clear that solar and wind alone would not be able to offset the loss of coal-powered generation capacity on their own, not the way they currently are.
Nuclear energy proponents would be happy to supply a solution: more nuclear. Yet this otherwise clean source of energy remains highly controversial in many parts of the world, which has hampered new additions. In some places, including the U.S., nuclear power is also having a hard time competing with renewables, made harder by a slew of state 
 efforts to reduce the share of coal in the energy mix.
Legislation is certainly a large part of how the world will eventually stop using coal for power generation. Yet what the most vocal clean energy activists might want to remember is that it won’t happen overnight. It cannot happen overnight because replacing coal with alternative sources of energy is not as easy as many people would like it to be and the data proves it. What we’re looking at is an energy evolution rather than a revolution and evolution takes longer.

Also known as No. 2 oil – heating oil is delivered to homes by tanker trucks and stored in storage tanks located in basements or below ground. Prior to 1885 most homes in America were heated using wood-burning brick fireplaces. In the early 19th century coal began to over-take wood-burning fireplaces as the primary method for heating homes.
 It was not until 1935 with the invention of the forced air furnace that heating oil became a commonplace fuel used to heat American homes.
 Heating oil is very similar to diesel fuel and is comprised of a mixture of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons. It is created through a distillation process in which petroleum is separated into its individual component parts. Distillation often takes place at a petroleum refinery where the process is run in a steady state.
 While most petroleum products condense at temperatures between 644 and 752 degrees Fahrenheit, heating oil condenses at lower temperature ranging between 482 and 662 degrees Fahrenheit.
 Heating oil is traded on both the NYMEX and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and oftentimes used to hedge jet and diesel fuel.  As demand for heating oil wanes during the summer months, refinery output of heating oil decreases. As demand decreases as do prices and trading is far less volatile during Q2 as more focus is put on gasoline.
 Given the current state of the US economy it should come as no surprise that heating oil prices would dip lower than usual as consumer spending continues to decrease. Weather plays a pivotal role in the demand for heating oil and harsh winters obviously create greater demand.
 While heating oil and crude oil do follow different seasonal trends their prices are still directly related. Since heating oil is derived from crude oil, increases in crude oil prices will in-turn increase heating oil prices. As demand for crude oil grows, the price of both gasoline and heating oil will increase.
 Only 7% of U.S. households use heating oil and this usage is mostly concentrated in the Northeast. Shipping costs play a crucial part in this regional distribution as the consumer price for heating oil is also related to the shipping distance.
 In 2008 heating oil prices were quite high due to the record-high crude oil prices found during the summer months. It is important to note that heating oil and diesel are also closely related as both distillates are generally made together during the refining process.
 As you can see from the chart above, distillate production has continued to increase over time, driving the price of heating oil up. As production begins to ramp-up in the second half of the year more diesel fuel will be needed for shipping and transportation which in turn will provide for greater heating oil production.
 This year, however, heating oil reserves were roughly 18% below their normal levels as high-demand for diesel fuel favored distillation of a larger percentage of diesel than heating fuel in order to meet growing demand.', 'https://oilprice.com/Energy/Heating-Oil/Heating-Oil-This-Essential-Fuel-Explained.html', '2019-10-27 05:55:04');

Today, I want to cover the production and consumption of coal.
The previous article on carbon dioxide emissions noted that the world is at an all-time high for carbon emissions. The biggest culprit is global consumption of coal, which is being largely driven by development in the Asia Pacific region.
In 2018, global coal consumption rose for the second straight year, but remains about 2.5 percent below the peak level in 2013. Asia Pacific coal consumption did reach a new all-time high, but consumption growth there has sharply slowed from the torrid pace of 2000-2010.
Coal consumption in most of the developing world continues to grow. Asia Pacific increased consumption by the most overall, but its 2.5 percent growth rate lagged Africa’s (+3.9 percent) and Central and South America (+3.7 percent). 
In the major developed regions of the world (including developed countries in Asia Pacific), coal consumption continues to decline. Coal consumption in the EU has been in decline since 1989, and U.S. coal consumption has steadily fallen for a decade.
The world overall has seen coal’s share decline in the overall energy consumption mix. In 2018, coal consumption represented 27.2 percent of primary energy consumption. That is down from 30 percent a decade ago. The five countries most dependent on coal for primary energy consumption are:
Asia Pacific comes in at 47.5 percent, while the EU and U.S. are respectively at 13.2 percent and 13.8 percent.
China remains firmly in first place as the world’s largest coal consumer and producer. The Top 5 producers, along with the share of global coal production, are:

The world’s most important source of energy was essential during the industrial revolution for the modernization of agrarian societies. However, the negative fallout of coal’s usage has become more apparent as global warming is having a catastrophic effect on the planet. 
Most countries have accepted their responsibility and signed the Paris Climate Agreement to mitigate the effects of climate change. Recently, a remarkable decline in coal consumption was noted in several industrialized countries with contradicting government policies concerning the energy transition. The two biggest Western economies, U.S. and Germany, have consumed significantly less coal this year. It might reassure environmentalists and other concerned citizens, but some underlying factors seem cyclical and therefore temporary.
The election of Trump was a significant boost for coal producers in the U.S. Despite his promise to support miners in their economic activities for what he called 
, the American coal industry has failed to reap the rewards of presidential political support.
It wasn’t the effort of miners, which failed to produce tangible results, but technological and market developments that have made alternative sources cheaper. Advances in drilling technology provide access to previously unreachable oil and gas reserves through hydraulic fracking. Due to the shale revolution the U.S. has become the largest oil and gas producer in the world. The flooding of the market with natural gas has 
 prices to a historic low, making it an attractive alternative for power producers. 
Also, advances in PV and wind turbine technology have reduced the costs of renewables. Therefore, energy companies have been installing new units at a relentless pace, in spite of President Trump''s focus on the fossil fuel industry. 
 to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in April, “U.S. monthly electricity generation from renewable sources exceeded coal-fired generation for the first time.”
In contrast to Washington, Berlin is firmly in favour of renewables and the energy transition. Therefore, the decision to shut down heavy polluting coal-fired power plants is in line with societal expectations and political goals. Besides closing individual facilities, the price tag 
 to emit CO2 have also risen due to new legislation. The more pollutant an energy source is, the higher the financial burden for producers. Burning coal emits almost twice as much CO2 compared to natural gas, which creates a financial incentive for producers to burn cleaner fuel sources.
Europe has been awash with cheap natural gas as inventories haven’t been drained during the winter burning season due to favourable weather conditions. Additionally, the competition between Russian gas and LNG is pushing prices even lower, which benefits the European customer. According to the 
, the struggle between shipped and piped natural gas has saved Europe $8 billion on the energy bill. Energy companies, therefore, substitute coal with cleaner and cheaper gas. 
Furthermore, innovation and decreasing costs of renewables have also benefitted consumers in Europe and Germany. The ever-larger production capacity of wind and solar energy, and regulation that favours cleaner sources of energy has increased the share of renewables in the energy mix.
Despite the good news, the situation is likely of a temporary nature. The perfect storm of innovation, legislation, and affordable alternative fuels has hit coal producers hard, but the end is not in sight yet. Despite Germany’s tough stance on CO2 emissions, the country is going for a slow phasing out of its coal-fired power plants until

Furthermore, China still maintains the largest fleet of coal-fired power plants in the world. Despite Beijing''s enormous investments in the domestic renewables sector, the country is also the largest investor in

, a news source dedicated solely to Chinese technology sector reporting. “China is aiming to close the AI technology gap with the US by 2030.”
As the world’s second-largest economy races to catch up with the United States in key cutting-edge technological industries such as Artificial Intelligence, its data center industry (the sector that uses networks of computer servers to host China’s massive swaths of data such as emails, photos, videos, and more) must also keep up with the ever-increasing demand for data storage. A fast-growing sector in an economy the size of China’s will surely send ripples through other sectors, and in the case of data centers this translates to a massive surge in electricity consumption for the Chinese data center industry over the next five years.
According to a new 
 conducted by environmental activism and advocacy group Greenpeace in conjunction with the North China Electric Power University, electricity consumption in this sector is projected to increase by a whopping 66 percent over the next half-decade. “By 2023, the sector is projected to consume 267 TWh of electricity, more than Australia’s total 2018 electricity consumption,” writes Greenpeace in a press release published alongside the study. The abstract goes on to point out that “China’s data center industry is currently powered 73% by coal.”
Due to these stark statistics, the researchers from Greenpeace outlined three different strategies that the industry could take in order to increase their use of renewable energies: “by building or investing in renewable projects, procuring clean power directly from renewable energy generators, and purchasing green power certificates.” Additionally, in response to the concern about China’s rising energy consumption and corresponding carbon footprint, Greenpeace East Asia climate and energy campaigner Ye Ruiqi said, “Power market reforms and rapid growth in wind and solar power have created unprecedented opportunities for China’s internet giants to procure clean energy. The data center sector can and should play a leading role in China’s energy transition from heavy reliance on coal to renewable energy.” 
With this in mind, the Greenpeace study looked into two different scenarios for the projection of China’s carbon emissions in the next four years, from 2019 to 2023. One takes a more conservative approach, assuming that the Chinese data center industry’s renewable energy intake will remain constant, at their current rate of 23 percent. In this more pessimistic (but perhaps more realistic) scenario, carbon dioxide emissions from this growing sector alone are expected to climb to 163 metric tons by 2023. 
Taking a more optimistic view, by assuming that the sector will take advantage of the aforementioned advances in wind and solar power and thus increase the amount of renewables in the data center industry’s energy mix to 30 percent, the sector will be able to cut the amount of emissions by 16 metric tons in the same timeline. The Greenpeace press release puts this in more tangible terms by pointing out that while 16 metric tons of savings may seem like a trivial amount as compared to the 147 that will still be emitted the data center sector even in the most optimistic projections, 16 metric tonnes is equivalent to approximately 10 million round-trip transatlantic flights --nothing to scoff at. 
TechNode points out that the Chinese government is already trying to move away from coal, reporting that “China’s top economic planning body established targets for renewable energy, increasing the share of non-fossil fuel energy to 20% by 2030.” If this is true, that means that in reality the data center sector’s emissions over the next five years will land somewhere between the two Greenpeace projections.

To compare, the spread averaged just over US$1 per MMBtu throughout 2018.
In the Permian, drillers have been 
 because of pipeline constraints. Surging volumes of natural gas have become a kind of a side product that drillers prefer to burn off instead of shutting in wells and missing out on monetizing the oil production gushing out in the Permian. Company executives admit that they wouldn’t flare as much gas as they do if they had a choice.

Explorers love to frequently trumpet exciting prospects. The dirty truth, however, is that the typical success rate is just one in seven wells.
Yet, even that grim statistic might be getting worse. 
Just a week ago, IHS Markit released an
 portending doom and gloom for the oil and gas industries. 
According to the numerical navel gazer, conventional oil and gas discoveries over the past three years have hit their lowest levels in 70 years. 
What’s more, no significant rebound is in sight. The report blames persistently low oil and gas prices that discourage wildcatters and also increasing competition from cheaper (
) unconventional drilling (shale and fracking).
At times like these, we are tempted to walk down memory lane to a time when gushers--like those of the Spindletop fame that ushered in the golden age of oil--were the norm.
(Click to enlarge)
It’s rather unfortunate that the biggest oil discoveries have more often than not been presided over by large, monolithic state-owned oil companies.
These giants don’t offer investors much leverage. 
Saudi Arabia’s Ghawar oil field is the grand-daddy of oil finds. The onshore field is the largest in the world and is located some 200 km east of Riyadh. 
It was discovered by the Standard Oil of California (forerunner of Arabian American Oil Company, later Saudi Aramco) in 1948. Standard Oil obtained concessions from the Saudi government for oil exploration and drilling.  
Back then, Saudi Arabia was a backwater, sparsely populated country before a water-discovering expedition serendipitously discovered oil instead.
The 2,800 km
super-giant has been divvied up into six parts with total reserves estimates at a mind-boggling 162 billion barrels of oil at the time of discovery. About 70 billion barrels of  oil reserves and 90 trillion cu. Ft of natural gas remained at the beginning of 2013. Daily production is pegged at ~3.8 million bbl/d (barrels per day).
The prize for the largest ownership (among publicly traded companies) goes to 
. (NYSE:CVX) which owns the biggest share of Kazakhstan’s Tengiz Oil Field, the sixth largest in the world. 
The Tengiz field is owned by a joint venture known as Tengizchevroil between Chevron (50%), 
. (NYSE:XOM) (25%), Kazakhstan’s state-owned oil and gas company KMG (20%) and LukaArco, a subsidiary of Russian oil company Lukoil (5%).
Tengiz was actually discovered by Soviet geologists in 1979 before Kazakhstan finalized the consortium agreement with Chevron in 1993. 
Tengiz has oil reserves estimated at 25 billion barrels with current production rate of 540,000 barrels per day. However, that figure is expected to rise to  approximately 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day when Chevron completes its ambitious
 for a princely $37 billion sometime in 2022.
Investors went wild over this deal, which saw CVX shares jump 30 percent in 1993. 
The company’s value has grown tremendously over the years, up nearly 1,300 percent since 1993 after accounting for the 2 for 1 stock split in 2004. 
That’s nearly double the 680-percent gain by the 
 over the period. 
That’s quite remarkable considering it paid $36 billion for Texaco in 2000.
Not all discoveries are gilt-edged, and big discoveries do not always translate to stellar share performance--at least for the supergiants.
Take Exxon Mobil, for instance.  
In May 2015, Exxon made what its executives described as a ‘fairytale discovery’ off the coast of tiny Guyana. At a time when discoveries are increasingly hard to come by, and almost certainly bound to be offshore in the deepwater in very complicated geologies, gushers don’t actually gush. Instead, they take ages to explore, develop and bring to production. 
By all accounts, Exxon’s 14-strong string of discoveries should have investor radar going wild.  
Exxon estimates its discovery contains more than 4 billion barrels of oil equivalent potentially producing 750,000 barrels per day by 2025. And it’s already developing for 
 early next year. 
So why did XOM shares actually shed more than 12 percent from May to December 2015? And why are they now down 22 percent since the discovery announcement?
That’s the problem with diversified supergiants. Investors get no real leverage to a specific discovery. 
The real leverage is when a small-cap or a mid-cap makes a huge discovery and sets itself up to be acquired by a giant. 
For the supergiants, there are no more ‘gushers’ that can make stock prices pop. Here on out, it’s only geopolitics, war, and the macro-economics of supply and demand that can really move the needle. 
If you want to make money on exploration, look to the smaller players.

Yet, the slowing economic growth in China is taking a toll on gas demand growth.
The Chinese government itself 
 that this year’s gas demand growth will slow down from last year’s growth pace.  
Government estimates show that Chinese natural gas consumption is set to grow by 10 percent this year, reaching 310 billion cubic meters (bcm). This year’s growth would be lower compared to last year’s 17.5-percent consumption increase, yet Chinese demand is expected to continue to grow until 2050, a government research report said this weekend, as carried by 
.
Even if it faces a slower pace of gas demand growth, China 
 its natural gas production, especially shale gas output, to reduce its import dependence while demand continues to grow in the foreseeable future.
Increasing conventional and unconventional natural gas production would be crucial for China to meet soaring demand while trying to cut the share of gas imports at the same time, according to the report prepared by the oil and gas department at the National Energy Administration (NEA) and a research arm of the State Council of China.
The longer-term strategy is to tap more domestic resources, but in the short term, China 
 policies to support the slowing economic growth amid an escalating U.S.-China trade war. China’s industrial output growth slowed down to 4.8 percent in July—the lowest level in 17 years—and well below the analyst consensus expectation of 5.8-percent growth and the 6.3-percent increase in June.
Despite the current economic slowdown, no one expects Chinese demand for natural gas to start declining any time soon. Analysts predict continued growth, driven by the coal-to-gas switch, although the growth could be lower than in the recent bumper years.
Yet, some analysts are not convinced that China could meet its targets to boost significantly its domestic natural gas production, especially shale gas, which could lead to even more import dependence in the future.
China is set to double its natural gas production by 2040, but 
 shale gas resources have led to a lower production outlook and expectations of more imports in the long term, Wood Mackenzie 
 last week. China’s domestic natural gas supply is forecast to double to 325 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2040 from 149 bcm in 2018, according to Xueke Wang, a consultant at Wood Mackenzie. Yet, this latest forecast for 2040 is 39 bcm lower than WoodMac’s previous outlook, mostly dragged down by lowered forecasts for shale gas and coal bed methane (CBM) production, Wood Mackenzie said in its recent research. 
State-held PetroChina, the country’s largest natural gas importer and the biggest oil and gas producer, 
 exploration of unconventional shale gas to reduce import dependence, and at the same time looks to diversify liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports amid the U.S.-China trade war, the company’s president Hou Qijun said last week.
“Had the trade war not been there, the US would have been a very promising gas supply growth source for China,” he said, as carried by South China Morning Post.
Due to the trade war, China has a tariff on imports of U.S. LNG, and due to the tariff and the trade spat, 
 as much LNG from the U.S. as it used to.
Chinese gas demand, however, is set to grow regardless of how successful China will be in tapping shale gas reserves.
“China will be the main driver for gas demand growth, though slower than in the recent past as economic growth slows, but still accounting for about 40% of total gas demand increase to 2024,” the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its Gas 2019 
 earlier this year.  
With growing demand, China is also set to soon become the world’s largest LNG importer 
 as early as in 2022, Wood Mackenzie said in a report in July.
Thanks to the coal-to-gas switch, China became the

Some will inherit the oil wealth of their parents without putting in the time and getting their shirt sleeves dirty. But there’s a long list of passionate, hard-working visionaries who built this industry, and continue to build it, all on their own. 
It’s the American Dream that dictates that even a lowly bookkeeper can become the richest man in the world with enough effort. 
Or that a gas station attendant could go on to create a multi-billion-dollar oil giant. 
Anything is possible in this country, from the presidency, as we have seen, to control of the billions upon billions in oil money. It’s all up for grabs and ambition trumps bloodline every time.  
If you want it, go out and get it: These 5 oil and gas billionaires certainly did: 
John D. Rockefeller of Standard Oil fame might very well be the richest man to ever walk the planet, with a fortune worth nearly 3x Jeff Bezos’ in today’s dollars.

A wildcatter, corporate raider, oil pioneer and hedge funder, Pickens was born in Oklahoma’s oil patch in 1928, so grew up during the Great Depression and started out as a paperboy, which he says was his

He wasn’t poor, but he certainly wasn’t rich, either. His parents were middle-class people working in regular jobs for the oil and gas industry.
T. Boone won a basketball scholarship to Texas A&M before transferring to Oklahoma A&M to major in geology. He tried to work a regular job as a geologist with Phillips Petroleum in Oklahoma. He was bored and frustrated, so the story goes, and called it quits. With the idea that he could do much better at tapping America’s vast oil potential on his own. And he was right. In 1956, with only $2,500, he started Petroleum Exploration, Inc (PEI). 
When he passed away in September 2019 at the age of 91, he was worth $500 million, but at the height of his career, he was worth

He got there by being incredibly shrewd, as described in Daniel Yergin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning book  
“Pickens was one of thousands driving around the oil states, using public phone booths as their offices, hustling, looking at deals. Selling them, getting a crew together and a well drilled and, if lucky, hitting oil or gas, dreaming all the while of making it big, really big,” Yergin wrote.
“Pickens got farther than most. He was smart and shrewd, with an ability to analyze and think through a problem, step by step.”

Hamm and Continental Resources pioneered horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing in the famous Bakken Oil Field - and that’s where he made his billions.

Back in 1996, so the story goes, Stephens knew what he wanted to do: get rich off of oil. He started out in the most modest fashion, with a tiny oil rig entity called “Big Dog Drilling Company”. It had only one rig, but that one rig eventually led to $1 billion. 
It took time and a lot of patience. Over two decades he built up Big Dog, and then changed its name to Endeavor, which is now a major acquisition target of supergiant oil companies with an estimated worth of up to

The latest string of downbeat economic data came from Germany, where its manufacturing sector seems to be stuck in negative territory. The IHS Markit/BME Germany Manufacturing PMI 
 a slight uptick in October to 41.9, up from 41.7 in September, but below market expectations of 42. Anything below 50 is considered a contraction in activity, so the figures are rather staggering. The number for September was the worst reading since the financial crisis.
“Hopes of a return to growth in Germany in the final quarter have been somewhat dashed,” Phil Smith, an economist at IHS Markit, which produced the PMI data, told 
. “Perhaps most concerning are the signs of increasing strain on the domestic economy.” For the broader Eurozone, the IHS Markit Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index 
 at 50.2 in October, which essentially means that economic activity, if not contracting, is stagnating across the continent.
But while Germany is exhibiting particularly weakness, the malaise is a global phenomenon. U.S. business equipment 
 for a second consecutive month in September.
Caterpillar made news this week when it reported disappointing third quarter figures and cut its full-year profit forecast. The equipment manufacturer is viewed as somewhat of a proxy for industrial activity. Caterpillar said that its earnings would take a hit as major companies hold off on equipment purchases due to concerns about the health of the global economy. 
Many analysts – including private investment banks but also the IMF, WTO and many central banks – tend to circle back to a familiar theme when discussing the current economic deceleration. “This slowdown in growth mainly reflects the ongoing weakness of international trade in an environment of persistent global uncertainties, which continue to weigh on the euro-area manufacturing sector and are dampening investment growth,” outgoing European Central Bank President Mario Draghi 
.
In other words, the fallout from the U.S.-China trade war is being felt globally.
China’s GDP expanded by 6 percent in the third quarter, the weakest growth rate in roughly three decades. “China’s economy is grappling with both external and internal headwinds,” Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics research at HSBC Holdings Plc, told 
.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates again next week, the latest in a global wave of monetary easing intended to stimulate the economy. It’s unclear if central banks can do enough to head off the economic slowdown.
The big question at this point is if the manufacturing recession bleeds over into the services sector. Services make up a larger portion of the U.S. economy, and that portion of the economy has proved more resilient to date.
“A further deterioration in jobs growth adds to the risk that the trade-led weakening is spreading further to the household sector, which could dampen growth further as we head towards the end of the year,” Chris Williamson, IHS Markit’s chief business economist told 
.
Another major problem for the global economy is the prospect of “peak car,” as 
 put it this week. Global auto sales have declined – not just in terms of growth, but on an absolute basis – and because auto manufacturing is such a large sector in many major economies, the contraction helps explain the manufacturing slowdown.
Worse, auto sales may not rebound to previous peaks. Sales declined in 2018, are on track to decline this year, and could fall again in 2020. The largest auto market in the world, China, is facing headwinds on two fronts – a slowing economy and

The woes afflicting the auto sector have the potential to hit oil demand on two fronts. Lower car sales in general means weaker growth to oil consumption. However, at the same time, electric vehicles are claiming a growing portion of the shrinking pie, a double-whammy to oil demand, as independent journalist Gregor Macdonald

More than two-thirds of all US oil is used in the transportation sector, so if Tesla is crushing it, the oil and gas industry is not. It means more demand is going to EVs and less to oil and gas.

With too much oil on the market, and projections of slowing demand growth, Saudi Arabia is in a difficult position. All eyes will be on OPEC’s upcoming monitoring committee meeting next month, where they will assess compliance to the production cut agreement. 
Nigeria, Iraq, and Russia will soon find themselves under the microscope for failing to adhere to agreed-upon production quotas. 
OPEC is under immense pressure to act aggressively to manipulate global oil inventories and keep prices stable, and the outcome of November’s meeting will reflect that pressure. 
The meeting will not result in any actionable change in quotas, rather it will assess compliance and make recommendations to the entire group for discussion and debate - and possibly action - at the full meeting, which will be held in the first week of December.
Beyond Iraq, Nigeria, and Russia, other OPEC+ signatories will be less eager to agree to additional cuts or an extension - particularly Saudi Arabia.
Russia’s involvement has always been on shaky ground: It doesn’t need higher oil prices to survive like the other oil-dependent economies such as Saudi Arabia. Still, it has signed onto the deal, and without Russia’s involvement, the production pact would be far less meaningful.
The meeting in December will not only be influenced by rogue members who have been overproducing, but an even bigger factor: oil demand growth. The EIA, IEA, OPEC, as well as a variety of analysts are all projecting a slowing demand growth for oil. When this slowing demand growth combines with growing US oil production, the outlook for 2020 oil inventories is not good, particularly for Saudi Arabia as it desperately tries to roll out the Aramco IPO. And Aramco’s valuation is tied to oil prices.
Between now and the November meeting, the market will be rife with speculation. OPEC will be faced with cutting more to prevent another glut - and giving away market share to the United States - or staying the course and watching prices fall further. Neither option is good for the oil cartel.

But these gains in renewables may not be enough to carry the world past the finish line with its climate goals.
The IEA also reported robust growth in the distributed solar sector, with the commercial market set to explode thanks to lower costs - even without subsidies. But this fast growth presents another challenge: Power grids are not all financially structured to handle the loss of paying customers, and the costs of grid maintenance will be spread across fewer and fewer customers. 
Biofuel output is also on track to increase by 25% by 2024, with China leading the way, tripling its ethanol production in that same timeframe thanks to government blending mandates.  
Finally, the IEA predicts that renewable generating capacity on the global grid will match that of coal capacity by 2024 IF major issues like grid integration and policy matters are addressed - but that’s a rather big “if”.  
The IEA considers the next five years to be crucial for the renewable energy market - and by default the fossil fuels market.

The stock has lost over half its value since the 52-week high just under a year ago and is now trading at trailing and forward P/Es of 11.59 and 7.21 respectively. Those are low, even for an energy stock, but there are signs that won’t last, and a bounce back looks likely.
When an industry is facing tough times, companies face a choice. They can baton down the hatches, reduce costs, cut production, and try to ride out the tough times, or they can take advantage of the weakness and expand in anticipation of a recovery. PDCE took the second tack, and that is in part why their stock has been hit so hard.
A couple of months ago, they announced the acquisition of SRC Energy in an all-stock deal valued at around $1.7 billion. Issuing stock for any purpose dilutes the value of existing shares, but the value of the acquisition also has to be considered. When a company makes that move in a depressed market, there is a tendency to undervalue the purchase, and that is what happened here.
SRC is a good fit for PDC. The acquisition leaves them with a large, contiguous lease in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) basin and should result in significant cost savings, yet the stock is lower now than when the deal was announced.
Perhaps that is why, of the 25 Wall Street analysts who cover the stock, 17 rate it either a “buy” or “strong buy”, with 8 “hold” recommendations, and no “sell” ratings. Those ratings are also strong for the most basic reason of all…PDC is value in a conventional sense.
The growth opportunities engendered by the merger, when combined with the low P/E, give a P/E to growth, or PEG ratio of 0.38. A PEG ratio of under 1.0 is generally taken to indicate that a stock is undervalued. If there is a knock on the stock, it comes from the fact that they have a heavy debt load and negative levered free cash flow, but a current ratio of 0.65 and a Moody''s announcement of a positive post-deal review of PDC’s credit rating both suggest that that is not too much of a problem.
Of course, to invest in PDCE, you have to believe that the fortunes of energy stocks overall will turn around before too long. There is an old investing saying that everything returns to the mean eventually, so the chances are it will…the question is when. With that in mind, this is a trade where an exit strategy is particularly important. If the sector weakness persists, the value is irrelevant, so a stop-loss somewhere just below $20 would be a good idea. If that is hit, you can always return to the stock when the sector does start to bounce.
If energy as a whole recovers, or even just holds steady from here, then the gamble that PDC took to expand during a period of weakness will pay off in a big way and the stock will probably outperform others in the sector because of it.

Russian military police deployed in the northeast border town of Kobane on Thursday under a deal with Turkey to drive out Kurdish fighters. After having stepped aside and announced a mass withdrawal from Syria to allow the Turks to pour across the border and attack the Kurds, US foreign policy is now confused at best. Late yesterday, talk again arose of a US rethink that may see tanks and heavy equipment deployed to keep the area’s oilfields from falling into the hands of Assad (and Russia) or ISIS. This is not, at this point, realistic: As soon as the US stepped aside and betrayed the Kurds who have controlled this oil, it was destined to go back to Assad. This will be a highly dynamic flashpoint in the coming weeks and months, particularly if foreign policy out of Washington continues to waiver and backpedal.
- BP and Eni have decided to postpone further oil exploration in Libya as the security situation worsens. The project being postponed - rather indefinitely for now - is a sizable one that included 3 major exploration blocks. It is a blow to Libya, which has tried and mostly failed so far, to attract foreign oil companies to develop its significant oil riches amongst the chaos. Libya is also wooing Suncor and Equinor, but no formal agreement to bring in these foreign oil companies has been reached.
- Union strikes at Brazil’s state-run Petrobras are scheduled for Saturday, as workers from 17 unions unite to protest the company’s suggested wage increase. Workers fear the proposed wage increase will come in lower than the estimated inflation rate, which fell to 2.89% in September. Right-wing Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is known for his anti-union sentiment. He’s moved to lower the country’s minimum wage and has spoken out against unions in general. The strike comes just weeks before what is expected to be Brazil’s largest oil auction, with Petrobras expected to be the recipient of payouts from winning bidders who must agree with the state-run oil giant on a payment schedule to compensate it for the work it has done already to the areas that will be auctioned off. The payments are expected to total as much as $45 billion.
- Rosneft has officially made the switch to euros instead of dollars for its oil contracts in order to steer clear of US sanctions. But while the dollar is unattractive at this time for Russia, euros aren’t a magic bullet due to their negative interest rates. Russia is now faced with more sanctions on top of those related to actions in Ukraine, this time for its dealings with sanctioned Venezuela. Russia is one of Venezuela’s only oil buyers, and it is not only purchasing Venezuelan crude but is reselling some of that oil to India, who then gets the benefit of Venezuelan crude without risking response from Washington. For the dollar, Rosneft’s switch to euros, if complete as it contends, could affect $89 billion in annual oil and oil product exports. But it is not expected to have a significant impact on the dollar in the long run. Meanwhile, rumors are still circulating about Rosneft’s planned takeover of PDVSA in exchange for wiping the slate clean for Venezuela’s debt. Both PDVSA and Rosneft have denied the allegations.
- Michigan-based DTE Energy has purchased a Louisiana pipeline and natural gas gathering system from Houston-based Momentum Midstream and Indigo Natural Resources for $2.25 billion. The gathering system will also include a 150-mile pipeline under construction and to be serviced by the second half of 2020. The deal will enhance DTE’s subsidiary DTE Midstream’s access to Gulf Coast markets. DTE Energy has previously said that it plans to invest up to $5 billion in the Midstream business from 2019 through 2023.
- Italian Eni has acquired Edison’s 70% stake in Egypt’s Block 12 of the offshore Habi gas concession in the eastern Mediterranean. This adds to Eni’s huge footprint offshore Egypt, where it made the Zohr field discovery--the largest ever in the Mediterranean Sea. As of August, Zohr had reached production of 2.7 bcfd and is producing ahead of plans.
- Russia this week sealed a number of energy deals with Africa. Rosatom is currently in talks with Ethiopia to build a nuclear power station, while Russia’s VEB and Russian export center signed two deals: one, an investment deal on an oil product pipeline in the Republic of Congo, and two, an MOU with Morocco MYA Energy to refinance a Moroccan refinery. Russia’s Rosegeo exploration signed a deal with Equatorial Guinea, South Sudan, and Rwanda to explore oil and gas reserves. The deals increase Russia’s footprint in Africa.
- Walmart has signed two virtual renewable power purchase agreements (VPPAs) with Engie US Wind that would build more than 366MW worth of wind projects across different US energy markets. The deal is part of Walmart’s plan of powering half of its operations using renewable energy by the end of 2025. In May, the company reported that 28% of its electricity needs were supplied by renewable sources.
- BP is working on potential revolutionary technology that could help solve one of crude oil’s long list of pressing environmental problems - the environmental toll that plastic PET containers have on the earth. The technology, if successful, would allow PET containers to be recycled repeatedly, unlike the current practice of landfilling the material after first use, or at most, one recycle per container before landfilling. The current amount of PET in use each year is 27 million tons - 23 million tons of which are bottles. BP will build a prototype plant at a cost of $25 million to test the viability of the project, which it calls BP Infinia.
- A new company, Qilak LNG, plans to partner with Exxon to ship LNG from Alaska''s North Slope to Asian markets on ice-breaking tankers. The company’s CEO is former Republican Alaska Lt. Governor Mead Treadwell. Qilak’s management said that its project would be much cheaper than the proposed Alaska LNG pipeline project.
- Nigerian Agip Oil, owned by Italian ENI, has announced a shut-in at its Aggah oilfield following pipeline leakage to forestall further damage to the environment. The authorities are still investigating the cause of a damaged pipeline and possible volume of leaked crude oil. 
- Maduro isn’t getting his hands on Citgo via creditors just yet. Yesterday, the US Treasury blocked the seizure by creditors of the refiner, allowing Venezuelan opposition forces to maintain control--for the time being--of the refinery subsidiary of state-run PDVSA. The Treasury ruled that no transfers for sales of Citgo shares linked to PDVSA could take place prior to January 22nd.
- Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB): While Schlumberger beat analyst estimates of $0.40 per share, coming in at $0.43, it''s not all roses, and is down from $0.46 this time last year. Russia and Australia were a boost for sales, but SLB saw a slowdown in Argentina and depressed prices in North America, where it saw more conservative capital spending by customers in this region.
- Halliburton (NYSE: HAL): HAL’s net income was as expected, at $0.34 per share. North America''s activity in Q3 declined, but its international activity is strong, and it is expected that customers outside North America will boost their spending.
- CNOOC Ltd: Chinese state-run CNOOC reported a 27.9% jump in capital spending in Q3 to $2.76 billion as China moves to increase oil and gas exploration and production in order to keep up with demand. CNOOC’s Q3 production was 100 million barrels, with nat gas production coming in at 143 billion cubic feet. This is up from 91 million barrels and 132 billion cubic feet in the same quarter last year. Still, its sales revenue was up just 0.8% due to lower oil and gas prices, which were $60.89 per barrel in Q3--a 15% drop year over year, and nat gas prices down 8.8%.', 'https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Violent-Clashes-Break-Out-In-Syria-Despite-Ceasefire.html', '2019-10-27 05:55:05');

- This year saw the reverse, with gains in Germany and France, but declines in Italy and the UK. “Italian oil demand has fallen y/y in 10 consecutive months, with the decline exceeding 10% in five of those months,” Standard Chartered wrote in a note.
- In August, demand contracted in all four countries – that has only happened four times over the last five years. “The combined fall of 410 thousand barrels per day (kb/d) is the second-weakest reading in six years, only exceeded in March 2019,” Standard Chartered said.
- In fact, total OECD oil demand fell by 463,000 bpd in August, the fourth consecutive month of year-on-year declines. That marks the weakest stretch for demand growth in the OECD in the last five years.
- Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau survived reelection, although lost his majority. He will need to partner with a party to his left, which potentially creates new hurdles for Canada’s oil industry.
- “The lack of pipeline capacities is likely to slow the growth in Canadian oil production,” Commerzbank said in a note.
- Alberta announced mandatory production cuts that started in January 2019, a move that helped rescue depressed prices for Western Canada Select (WCS).
- However, if WCS narrows too close to WTI, it closes off the option of shipping crude by rail. In other words, without new pipeline capacity, WCS will have to trade at a deeper discount in order to allow for the egress of more oil.
- Prime Minister Trudeau reiterated his support for the Trans Mountain Expansion in the days after the election.
- Oil prices have been range bound, but light streams of crude are trading at higher prices relative to heavy oils.
- The forthcoming IMO regulations on sulfur content are lending a premium to lighter and sweeter oil.
- “Refined product prices are finally reflecting demand shifts underway as IMO 2020 approaches,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note. “For one, high sulfur fuel oil (HSFO) prices have utterly collapsed and spreads between HSFO and ultra-low sulfur fuel oil (ULSFO) have widened to nearly -$40/bbl.”
- The disruption could be significant. “Given the changes in product prices and cracks, refiners globally will opt to maximize production of ULSFO and gasoil and minimize production of HSFO and gasoline by adjusting utilization rates at specific refinery units,” the bank said.
- Chile has been rocked by the most serious bout of political instability since the fall of the dictatorship decades ago. Thousands of protestors are denouncing the government over massive inequality and painful austerity measures.
- Chile is the largest producer of copper in the world. Unions at copper mines

- Copper prices in New York rose to one-month highs and are up about 4 percent since the start of October.
- “Major streets and highways around Santiago have been shut down with any significant port disruptions offering up near term support to copper prices,” said Colin Hamilton, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, according to Bloomberg.
- Investors have lost faith in struggling U.S. shale drillers, and capital markets have essentially closed off.
- Banks are likely to restrict credit lines to shale companies during the twice-a-year redetermination period underway now.
- Investors say there are “five to 10 too many” companies in the sector, according to 
.
- More than 200 energy companies in North America have gone bankrupt since 2015, and that figure is on the rise this year after slowing down in 2018.
- After oil prices crashed in 2014, investors were generous with lending and equity injections. U.S. oil and gas producers were able to raise $56.6 billion in combined debt and equity in 2016 when oil prices crashed, the FT said.
- This year, that figure has fallen to just $19.4 billion.
- Production may continue to grow, but it will increasingly come from the oil majors and other large companies who can self-finance.
- European coal power generators could post as much as $7.3 billion in losses this year, due to falling costs for renewable energy and a steep drop in natural gas prices. At the same time, the price for carbon credits on the European cap-and-trade system have climbed, which hits coal economics worse than other fuels.
- Nearly 80 percent of lignite and hard coal-fired generation is unprofitable this year, according to Carbon Tracker.
- Germany, the UK and Spain have consumed 70 percent less coal this year compared to last, a staggering decline.
- “EU coal generators are hemorrhaging cash because they cannot compete with cheap renewables and gas and this will only get worse,” 
 Matt Gray, Carbon Tracker’s head of power and utilities. “Getting off coal is cheap and can be a win-win for consumers and shareholders, providing governments and investors work with local communities.”
- Global car sales declined in 2018 and are on track to decline even further this year and again in 2020.
- Part of the problem is an economic slowdown, but analysts are starting to believe that the auto industry is past its peak. In the U.S., for instance, car sales peaked in 2016, and in 2000 in the EU, and in 1990 in Japan, according to 
.
- Now, China may have passed its peak. China’s car sales are down 12 percent since the middle of last year and sales are down 14 percent in India.
- The woes in the auto sector are a result of the economic slowdown, but they are also contributing to the slowdown since auto manufacturing accounts for 5.7 percent of global GDP and 8 percent of global trade.

Helping to underpin prices this week was a surprise decline in U.S. inventories and optimism about more efforts to support prices by OPEC and its allies. Gains were likely capped by gloomy growth forecasts over the outlook for global demand.
At the end of the week, traders continued to react to Wednesday’s government weekly inventory report that showed an unexpected drop in supply.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), crude inventories fell 1.7 million barrels in the week ended October 18, compared with analysts’ expectations for a 2.2 million barrel build. This was a stark contrast with earlier inventory data released by industry group the American Petroleum Institute (API), which showed a build of 4.5 million barrels in U.S. crude stocks.
The EIA said the drawdown in weekly stocks came as refiners hiked crude runs and oil imports fell, which prodded a jump in both benchmark crude grades on Wednesday.
Traders are betting on OPEC and its allies extending supply curbs to offset the weaker demand outlook in 2020.
Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s de facto leader, wants to focus first on boosting adherence to the group’s production-reduction pact with Russia and other non-members, an alliance known as OPEC+, before committing to more cuts, sources told Reuters.
Concerns about demand are weighing on prices with headwinds facing the U.S. and global economy likely to intensify in the months ahead.
Although trade talks over the first phase of a partial trade deal between the United States and China are progressing well, crude oil traders don’t feel an agreement between the two economic powerhouses will have much of a positive impact on demand until the tariffs are lifted.
Economists in a Reuters poll said a steeper decline in global economic growth remains more likely than a synchronized recovery, even as multiple central banks dole out rounds of monetary easing.
Another Reuters poll of economists found the recent truce in the U.S.-China trade war is not an economic turning point and has done nothing to reduce the risk that the United States could slip into recession in the next two years.
In Europe, a survey from economic powerhouse Germany, showed employment in the nation’s private sector fell for the first time in six years in October, suggesting that a third-quarter slowdown could stretch into the closing months of the year.
Economic growth across Asia is set to slow more than expected, according to the latest projections by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
In its Regional Economic Outlook report released Wednesday, the IMF said growth in Asia could moderate to 5% in 2019, and 5.1% in 2020 – that’s 0.4% and 0.3% lower than its April projections.
Earlier this week, the IMF had projected the Chinese economy could grow at 5.8% next year – slower than the 6.1% forecast for 2019.
The main trend is up according to the weekly swing chart, however, momentum has been trending lower since the week ending September 20.
A trade through $50.33 will change the main trend to down. A move through $62.74 will signal a resumption of the uptrend.
The minor trend is down. However, a new minor bottom was formed at $50.89.
The minor range is $45.14 to $64.89. Its 50% to 61.8% zone at $55.02 to $52.68 is support.
Another minor range is $62.74 to $50.89. Its 50% level is $56.82. Crossing to the strong side of this level next week will indicate the buying is getting stronger.
The main range is $73.40 to $45.14. Overcoming the 50% level at $56.82 could trigger an acceleration to the upside with the next target zone coming in at $59.27 to $62.60.
Based on this week’s price action, the direction of the December WTI crude oil futures contract next week is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the 50% level at $55.02.
A sustained move over $55.02 will indicate the presence of buyers. If this move creates enough upside momentum then look for a move into the minor pivot at $56.82. Look for sellers on the first test of this level.
Overcoming $56.82 will indicate the buying is getting stronger. This could trigger an acceleration to the upside with the next target the major 50% level at $59.27.
The inability to overcome $56.82 will indicate that sellers are coming in to stop the rally. Crossing back under the 50% level at $55.02 will indicate the selling is getting stronger. This could trigger a further break into the 61.8% level at $52.68. This is the last potential support before the $50.89 minor bottom and the $50.33 main bottom.
The rebound in the crude oil market this week was mostly driven by expectations of additional production cuts by OPEC and its allies. The group will meet on December 5 – 6 to decide on the new strategy. This news is expected to continue to underpin the market over the near-term. Meanwhile, concerns over demand will prevent a huge surge to the upside.
The wildcard is U.S.-China trade relations. As long as the two sides are negotiating then look for a slight upside bias. The announcement of a trade deal could spike prices higher.

Oil was down at the start of trading on Friday, but was poised to close out the week with modest gains on the back of EIA inventory drawdowns and rumors of OPEC+ cuts.
. Top U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators have 
 a plan in which China would buy more farm products in exchange for the U.S. removing some tariffs, according to Reuters. The outlines of the partial deal are striking since they would essentially attempt to take the trading relationship back to where it was before the trade war, without touching the hot button issues of intellectual property. Even still, there is a long way to go – for now, President Trump has only agreed to cancel the October 15 tariff increase on $250 billion worth of goods. China is offering more purchases, but also wants the planned December tariffs scrapped.
. A new government 
 found that a loophole has allowed offshore oil drillers to avoid paying a combined $18 billion in royalties to the U.S. government over the past few decades. 
. Exports of gasoline, diesel and other refined products have soared over the past decade, but growth came to a halt in the first half of 2019. Exports averaged 5.47 mb/d, according to the 
, up by a paltry 19,000 bpd (0.3 percent) from the same period in 2018. The agency said the sudden slowdown is likely due to lower refinery runs and a slowing economy.
. Russia’s Rosneft has entirely 
 the currency of its oil contracts from dollars to euros, a move intended to avoid U.S. sanctions. It is part of a broader de-dollarisation plan by the Russian government.
. With the implementation of the IMO rules on marine fuels just two months away, stockpiles of low-sulfur fuels held in floating storage around the key storage hub of Singapore are growing. Roughly 32 supertankers are anchored in Malaysian waters near Singapore, according to 
.
A new report from the IEA explores the “game-changing” potential of offshore wind. Costs for the technology are forecasted to fall by 40 percent by 2030. The IEA said the magnitude of the potential is on par with two other energy revolutions of the past decade – fracking for shale and the explosive growth of solar. “Looking at the future of offshore wind…it has the potential to join the ranks of shale [gas] and solar photovoltaics in terms of steep cost reductions,” IEA executive director Fatih Birol 
. Total investment in the offshore wind sector could reach $840 billion over the next two decades. 
. Russia’s energy minister Alexander Novak 
 that U.S. oil production growth leveling off. “In the near future, if forecasts turn out correct, we will see a plateau in production,” Novak said.
. The Trump administration 
 required bond payments by Citgo to creditors. The U.S.-based Venezuelan refining company faced imminent breakup due to a $913 million bond payment, but the Trump administration views the company has crucial to the opposition leader Juan Guaidó. The move gives Citgo a 90-day reprieve.

 dismissed rising concerns about the longevity of the shale boom. “We see a long, healthy pace of activity in the Permian and Texas for decades to come,” Steve Green, president of Chevron’s North American business, 
 at a forum sponsored by the Texas Oil & Gas Association.
. Kuwait may cut its long-term oil plans due to climate change, a move that would raise eye-brows since most state-owned companies have not waded into such waters. Bloomberg 
 that a source with knowledge of internal discussions said that Kuwait Petroleum Corp. could cut its plans to reach 4 mb/d of capacity by 2020 to 3.125 mb/d instead. It would also lower its 2040 target to 4 mb/d instead of 4.75 mb/d.
 a larger-than-expected decline in profits for the third quarter, due to a decline in natural gas prices and production. Earnings fell to $2.59 billion, down from $4.84 billion a year earlier.
